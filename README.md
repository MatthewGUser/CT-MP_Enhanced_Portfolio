# CT-MP Enhanced Portfolio
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. The website serves as a showcase of my skills, work experience, projects, and other relevant information about my journey as a software developer. Built using HTML and CSS, this portfolio is designed with simplicity and clarity to create a professional online presence.

## Project Overview
This portfolio website has a clean, easy-to-navigate structure with multiple pages, each dedicated to a specific section. It’s a digital resume of sorts, with all the essential details a potential employer or client would need to learn more about me and my work.

## Features
- **Home Page:** A brief introduction, including a welcome message and profile image.
- **About Me:** A section dedicated to my background, education, career goals, and personal interests.
- **Skills:** Showcases my technical skills, programming languages, and tools I'm proficient in.
- **Projects:** Highlights my past projects with descriptions, links, and technologies used.
- **Contact:** Provides a contact form and links to my social media profiles for easy communication.
## File Structure
